# pile-shuffle-buddy

This is just a small project I made to learn pyautogui library. Plus it made a little gold along the way. 

Once started the bot will start bnet, launch the game, select a character, enter game, open tailoring, open vendor menu, clicks sell,
then types in the item you want to make, clicks craft all, waits 285 secs, then loops through selling the items 15 times, then repeats craft all. 
This will loop through 100 times.
